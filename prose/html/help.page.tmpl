            I get a permission denied when trying to SSH
        </h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately SHA-2 RSA keys are <strong>not</strong> currently supported.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, due to a shortcoming in Go’s x/crypto/ssh package, we
            not currently support access via new SSH RSA keys: only the old SHA-1 ones will work.
            Until we sort this out you’ll either need an SHA-1 RSA key or a key with another
            algorithm, e.g. Ed25519. Not sure what type of keys you have? You can check with the
            following:
        </p>
        <pre>$ find ~/.ssh/id_*.pub -exec ssh-keygen -l -f {} \;</pre>
        <p>If you’re curious about the inner workings of this problem have a look at:</p>

            What should my blog folder look like?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Currently {{.Site.Domain}} only supports a flat folder structure.  Therefore,
            <code>scp -r</code> is not permitted.  We also only allow <code>.md</code> files to be
            uploaded.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/neurosnap/prose-blog">Here is the source to my blog on this platform</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        Below is an example of what your blog folder should look like:
        </p>
            <pre>blog/
first-post.md
second-post.md
third-post.md</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Underscores and hyphens are permitted and will be automatically removed from the title of the post.

            How do I update metadata like publish date and title?
        </h2>
        <p>
        We support adding frontmatter to the top of your markdown posts.  A frontmatter looks like the following:
        <pre>---
title: some title!
description: this is a great description
date: 2022-06-28
---</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            List of available variables:
            <ul>
                <li>title (custom title not dependent on filename)</li>
                <li>description (what is the purpose of this post?  It's also added to meta tag)</li>
                <li>date (format must be YYYY-MM-DD)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="post-update">
        <h2 class="text-xl">
            <a href="#post-update" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>
            How do I update a post?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Updating a post requires that you update the source document and then run the <code>scp</code>
            command again.  If the filename remains the same, then the post will be updated.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="post-delete">
        <h2 class="text-xl">
            <a href="#post-delete" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>
            How do I delete a post?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Because <code>scp</code> does not natively support deleting files, I didn't want to bake
            that behavior into my ssh server.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, if a user wants to delete a post they can delete the contents of the file and
            then upload it to our server.  If the file contains 0 bytes, we will remove the post.
            For example, if you want to delete <code>delete.md</code> you could:
        </p>

        <pre>
cp /dev/null delete.md
scp ./delete.md {{.Site.Domain}}:/</pre>

        <p>
            Alternatively, you can go to <code>ssh {{.Site.Domain}}</code> and select "Manage posts."
            Then you can highlight the post you want to delete and then press "X."  It will ask for
            confirmation before actually removing the post.
        </p>

            When I want to publish a new post, do I have to upload all posts everytime?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Nope!  Just <code>scp</code> the file you want to publish.  For example, if you created
            a new post called <code>taco-tuesday.md</code> then you would publish it like this:
        </p>
        <pre>scp ./taco-tuesday.md {{.Site.Domain}}:</pre>

            How can I customize my blog page?
        </h2>
        <p>
        There's a special file you can upload `_readme.md` which will allow
        users to add a bio and links to their blog landing page.
        <pre>---
title: some title!
description: this is a great description
nav:
    - google: https://google.com
    - site: https://some.site

Here is a quick intro to my personal blog!
This will show up on the blog landing page.

        <p>
            List of available variables:
            <ul>
                <li>title (name of the blog, default: "X's blog")</li>
                <li>description (description of blog)</li>

            How can I change the theme of my blog?
        </h2>
        <p>
            There's a special file you can upload `_styles.css` which will allow
            users to add a CSS file to their page.  It will be the final CSS file
            loaded on the page so it will overwrite whatever styles have previously
            been added.  We've also added a couple of convenience id's attached to the
            body element for the blog and post pages.
        </p>
        <pre>/* _styles.css */
#post {
    color: green;
}

#blog {
    color: tomato;
}</pre>
        <p>Then just upload the file:</p>
        <pre>scp _styles.css <username>@prose.sh:/</pre>
    </section>

    <section id="blog-url">
        <h2 class="text-xl">

            How can I automatically publish my post?
        </h2>
        <p>
            There is a github action that we built to make it easy to publish your blog automatically.
        </p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>
            A user also created a systemd task to automatically publish new posts.  <a href="https://github.com/neurosnap/lists.sh/discussions/24">Check out this github discussion for more details.</a>

            Can I create multiple accounts?
        </h2>
        <p>
           Yes!  You can either a) create a new keypair and use that for authentication
           or b) use the same keypair and ssh into our CMS using our special username
           <code>ssh new@{{.Site.Domain}}</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that if you use the same keypair for multiple accounts, you will need to
            always specify the user when logging into our CMS.

            Setup a custom domain
        </h2>
        <p>
            A blog can be accessed from a custom domain.
            HTTPS will be automatically enabled and a certificate will be retrieved
            from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>. In order for this to work,
            2 DNS records need to be created:
        </p>

        <p>CNAME for the domain to prose (subdomains or DNS hosting with CNAME flattening) or A record</p>
        <pre>CNAME subdomain.yourcustomdomain.com -> prose.sh</pre>
        <p>Resulting in:</p>
        <pre>subdomain.yourcustomdomain.com.         300     IN      CNAME   prose.sh.</pre>
        <p>And a TXT record to tell Prose what blog is hosted on that domain at the subdomain entry _prose</p>
        <pre>TXT _prose.subdomain.yourcustomdomain.com -> yourproseusername</pre>
        <p>Resulting in:</p>
        <pre>_prose.subdomain.yourcustomdomain.com.         300     IN      TXT     "hey"</pre>
