            I get a permission denied when trying to SSH
        </h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately SHA-2 RSA keys are <strong>not</strong> currently supported.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, due to a shortcoming in Go’s x/crypto/ssh package, Soft Serve does
            not currently support access via new SSH RSA keys: only the old SHA-1 ones will work.
            Until we sort this out you’ll either need an SHA-1 RSA key or a key with another
            algorithm, e.g. Ed25519. Not sure what type of keys you have? You can check with the
            following:
        </p>
        <pre>$ find ~/.ssh/id_*.pub -exec ssh-keygen -l -f {} \;</pre>
        <p>If you’re curious about the inner workings of this problem have a look at:</p>

            <a href="#multiple-feeds" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>
            Can I create multiple feed lists?
        </h2>
        <p>
           You are free to upload as many feed lists as you like,
           referencing different email and digest intervals.

    <section id="post-update">
        <h2 class="text-xl">
            <a href="#post-update" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>
            How do I update a list?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Updating a list requires that you update the source document and then run the <code>scp</code>
            command again.  If the filename remains the same, then the list will be updated.
        </p>

    <section id="post-delete">
        <h2 class="text-xl">
            <a href="#post-delete" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>
            How do I delete a list?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Because <code>scp</code> does not natively support deleting files, I didn't want to bake
            that behavior into my ssh server.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, if a user wants to delete a post they can delete the contents of the file and
            then upload it to our server.  If the file contains 0 bytes, we will remove the post.
            For example, if you want to delete <code>delete.txt</code> you could:
        </p>

        <pre>
cp /dev/null delete.txt
scp ./delete.txt {{.Site.Domain}}:/</pre>

        <p>
            Alternatively, you can go to <code>ssh {{.Site.Domain}}</code> and select "Manage posts."
            Then you can highlight the post you want to delete and then press "X."  It will ask for
            confirmation before actually removing the list.

    <section id="multiple-accounts">
        <h2 class="text-xl">
            <a href="#multiple-accounts" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>
            Can I create multiple accounts?
        </h2>
        <p>
           Yes!  You can either a) create a new keypair and use that for authentication
           or b) use the same keypair and ssh into our CMS using our special username
           <code>ssh new@{{.Site.Domain}}</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that if you use the same keypair for multiple accounts, you will need to
            always specify the user when logging into our CMS.
