## development

- `golang` >= 1.21.0
- `direnv` to load environment vars

```bash
cp ./.env.example .env
```

Initialize local env variables using direnv

```bash
echo dotenv > .envrc && direnv allow
```

Boot up database

```bash
docker compose up -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml --profile db -d
```

Create db and migrate

```bash
make create
make migrate
```

Build services

```bash
make build
```

All services are built inside the `./build` folder.

If you want to start prose execute these binaries from the project root directory:

```bash
./build/prose-web
# in a separate terminal
./build/prose-ssh
```


## deployment

We use an image based deployment, so all of our images are uploaded to
[ghcr.io/picosh/pico](https://github.com/picosh/pico/packages)

```bash
DOCKER_TAG=latest make bp-all
```

Once images are built, docker compose is used to stand up the services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This makes use of a production `.env.prod` environment file which defines
the various listening addresses and services that will be started. For production,
we add a `.envrc` containing the following:

```bash
export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.prod.yml
export COMPOSE_PROFILES=services,caddy
```

And symlink `.env` to `.env.prod`:

```bash
ln -s .env.prod .env
```

This allows us to use docker-compose normally as we would in development.

For any migrations, logging into the our database server, pulling the changes
to migrations and running `make latest` is all that is needed.
