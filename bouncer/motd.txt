Welcome to irc.pico.sh!

This is a hosted Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bouncer service for pico users.

Documentation for this service is available online:

https://pico.sh/bouncer

In order to chat with other users, you must configure an IRC network.
IRC networks are independent entities which are not affiliated with pico.

The recommended network for pico users is Libera Chat: https://libera.chat

Once this bouncer is configured, it will keep your IRC user online permanently.
So even after quitting this chat app it'll keep your user online.

To connect to Libera Chat now, enter the following commands:

/msg BouncerServ help

# in the private message
network create -addr irc.libera.chat -nick <user> -enabled false

# if you don't have an account skip this step
sasl set-plain -network irc.libera.chat <user> <sasl-pass>

network update libera -enabled true
/j #pico.sh

Once connected, it is recommended to register an account with the network.
Type "/msg NickServ help register" to send a message to the Libera Chat account
registration system for details.
